# Menpha.khophi.com API

Welcome to Menpha.khophi.com API. The backend API is responsible for sending and receiving responses from the front end UI.

With Menpha.khophi.com, you get to read and be informed more in less time it takes with current information sharing platforms. We care more about helping you get more from reading, but spending less time.

By restricting the amount of information sharable per card, Menpha.khophi.com encourages writers and authors to share only what matters, needed by the average on-the-go reader. Further reading material can be added for the interested.

Visit Menpha.khophi.com to see in action.

## To Contribute 

Remember, I be human, and no guru. There might be a ton of things I'm doing wrong. If you know a BETTER way of handling something, kindly draw my attention to, point me to a resource that tackles that, or explain to me. There's always room for improvement and I hope to learn.

There are a ton of "Best Practices" out there. But, I believe in Common Sense too!

If "Best Practice" suggests I walk to the Moon, I'll listen to Common Sense, and use a a Rocket instead!

Kindly take note of these tips to contributing:

 - Remember to make changes to your own forked repository. Do not contribute directly to my repository
